# Welcome

Please use { width=50% } in line with your image so Latex doesn't go crazy.

![Logo of KULeuven](KULlogo.pdf){ width=50% }

Listings are enabled to make some clean and pretty code snippets.

```c
int a = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    // Simple snippet of code
    printf("i = %d", i);
}
```

As usual, math mode is present.

$$
i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}|\Psi (t)\rangle =\hat {H}|\Psi (t)\rangle
$$

And there is many more things you can do just with a simple Markdown file!
