# Introduction

## Why is measuring important ?

![Typical system](image.png)

In a feedback system, we want some input to transform in a specific output. Later, we want to measure this output to adapt the control and see how effective this is. 

Using the standard $G$ and $H$ notation we can find that:


\begin{align}
    y &= \frac{G}{1+GH}r & e&=\frac{1}{1+GH}r\\
    y&= \lim_{G\rightarrow\infty} \frac{G}{1+GH}r \approx \frac{1}{H}r
\end{align}


## General principles

> Building a measurement system is transforming energy/information from one domain to another.

We first start by building the physical knowledge (build physical quantity model), mathematical reasoning (find how accurate we can make the model to reflect the system) and finally we must take noise and other limits into consideration.

In a system, at a high-level, there is 2 forms of variables:

1. **Across Variables:** describe the *state*, in **parallel** with the terminal. Effort to change the state
2. **Through Variables:** describe the *flow*, in **series** with the terminal.

Then combining those two can give us some fundamental quantities:
- $A\cdot T$: **power** generated or dissipated in the element
- $A/T$: **impedance** of the system. Describes how an element transforms an $A$ into a $T$

## Modelling a system : the physical model

We usually want to map the IO behavior based on physical knowledge. Each model tries to represent reality but will always introduce errors or not take into account higher order phenomena. 

For example, we can model a pressure change using a diaphragm to a capacitance change. If we take a simple spring model we don't take second order term into account which introduces errors.

| System optimization is possible              | Derivation of this formula is not always straightforward/possible |
| Calibration techniques can be easily derived | Errors due to tolerances in fabrication                           |
